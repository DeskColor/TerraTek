# Project Overview
This project presents the development of TerraTek, an IoT-based monitoring system designed
to assist a customer in tracking environmental data. The system utilizes Arduino-controlled
sensor clusters to gather data on key parameters such as rainfall, water pH, water level, and
so on, which are then transmitted to a centralized server. A responsive web interface allows
users to visualize data trends and generate reports to aid decision-making processes. Through
data analysis, the project demonstrates improved statistics by utilizing historical and real-time
data. Future work will involve extending the systemâ€™s capabilities to include real-time camera
monitoring based on sensor data.
