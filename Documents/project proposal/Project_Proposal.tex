AgriSense is a digital system that will enable users to make more informed farming decisions with aid of technology.
The system will be composed of a network of multiple sensors that are distributed evenly across a field. Sensors will send data back to a central
database, and the user will be able to access the sensor network through a web interface. Users will have the ability to run reports and choose
from several data visualizations using the web interface with newly transmitted data.

\section*{Goals}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Read data from a network of sensors.
\item Transmit sensor data to a central server.
\item Store sensor data in a database.
\item Display sensor data using a web interface.
\item Run reports and visualizations to enable users to make informed farming decisions.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Timeline}
\subsection*{Semester One}
In the first semester we will create the back end for the AgriSense system. This includes data collection, transmission,
and storage.
\subsection*{Semester Two}
In the second semester we will create the front end for the AgriSense system. This includes the web interface 
and data visualizations.
